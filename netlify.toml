# Redirects and rewrites are usually handled by the Next.js plugin.
# If you need custom redirects beyond what Next.js provides (e.g., for marketing URLs),
# you can add them here. For typical SPA/Next.js routing, the plugin suffices.
# Example redirect:
# [[redirects]]
#   from = "/old-path"
#   to = "/new-path"
#   status = 301 # Permanent redirect

# If you were not using the Next.js plugin, you might need a catch-all for SPAs:
# [[redirects]]
#  from = "/*"
#  to = "/index.html" # Or your Next.js SSR handler
#  status = 200
# But with the plugin, this is generally not needed.
